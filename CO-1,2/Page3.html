<h1> Welcome to my blog </h1>
<h2> The blog is about Russian Leaders </h2>
<p> Russian leaders are the individuals who have governed Russia at different points in history, shaping its politics, society, and global role. Early leaders included Tsars like Peter the Great, who modernized Russia, and Catherine the Great, who expanded the empire. After the 1917 Revolution, Vladimir Lenin became the first leader of the Soviet Union, followed by Joseph Stalin, who industrialized the country but ruled harshly. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia became a federation, and modern leaders such as Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin have played major roles in shaping today’s Russia. </p>
